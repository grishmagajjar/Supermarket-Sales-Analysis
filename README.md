# Supermarket Sales Analysis
## Situation:
The objective of this project was to analyze supermarket data to gain actionable insights that could help improve business operations and customer satisfaction. The analysis involved Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns within the data.

## Task:
My responsibilities included:

- Performing an in-depth EDA to identify key insights.
- Cleaning and processing the data, including handling duplicate rows and missing values.
- Conducting univariate and bivariate analysis, along with correlation analysis, to reveal relationships within the data.
- Using Python libraries to visualize findings for better comprehension.
  
## Action:

### Data Preparation:

Imported and processed the dataset using pandas for data manipulation and numpy for numerical calculations.
Identified and dealt with duplicate rows and missing values to ensure data quality.
Conducted initial data exploration to understand data structure and key attributes.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Performed univariate analysis to analyze individual features like sales, product categories, and customer demographics.
Conducted bivariate analysis to identify relationships between variables, such as sales performance by region or time.
Calculated and visualized correlation matrices to understand relationships between numeric features.

### Data Visualization:
Used Seaborn and matplotlib to create insightful visualizations, including:
Histograms for sales distribution.
Heatmaps for correlation analysis.
Box plots and scatter plots to identify trends and outliers.

## Result:
Delivered actionable insights into supermarket operations, such as top-performing product categories, seasonal sales trends, and regions with high growth potential.
Provided stakeholders with clear visualizations and a detailed understanding of the data, supporting data-driven decision-making.

## Tools Used:
- Jupyter Notebook: For developing and documenting the project.
- Python Libraries:
-- pandas and numpy for data manipulation and analysis.
-- Seaborn and matplotlib for creating detailed plots and charts.
